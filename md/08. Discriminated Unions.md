## 8. Discriminated Unions

Discriminated unions in F# allow you to define types that can represent a value that could be one of several different, but fixed, types. They are a powerful way to model data that can take on multiple forms.

### Creating Custom Types

Discriminated unions are defined using the `type` keyword followed by a list of possible cases.

#### Defining a Discriminated Union

```fsharp
type Shape =
    | Circle of radius: float
    | Rectangle of width: float * height: float
    | Triangle of base: float * height: float
```

In this example, `Shape` is a discriminated union that can be a `Circle`, `Rectangle`, or `Triangle`, each with associated data.

#### Creating Instances

```fsharp
let circle = Circle 5.0
let rectangle = Rectangle (4.0, 6.0)
let triangle = Triangle (3.0, 4.0)
```

### Pattern Matching with Unions

Pattern matching is a natural way to work with discriminated unions, allowing you to handle each case separately.

#### Basic Pattern Matching

```fsharp
let describeShape shape =
    match shape with
    | Circle radius -> sprintf "Circle with radius %f" radius
    | Rectangle (width, height) -> sprintf "Rectangle with width %f and height %f" width height
    | Triangle (base, height) -> sprintf "Triangle with base %f and height %f" base height

printfn "%s" (describeShape circle)      // Outputs: Circle with radius 5.000000
printfn "%s" (describeShape rectangle)   // Outputs: Rectangle with width 4.000000 and height 6.000000
printfn "%s" (describeShape triangle)    // Outputs: Triangle with base 3.000000 and height 4.000000
```

#### Using Guards with Pattern Matching

You can add guards to pattern matching to handle more specific cases:

```fsharp
let describeShapeWithGuard shape =
    match shape with
    | Circle radius when radius > 10.0 -> "Large circle"
    | Circle radius -> "Small circle"
    | Rectangle (width, height) when width = height -> "Square"
    | Rectangle (width, height) -> "Rectangle"
    | Triangle (base, height) -> "Triangle"

printfn "%s" (describeShapeWithGuard (Circle 15.0))  // Outputs: Large circle
printfn "%s" (describeShapeWithGuard (Circle 5.0))   // Outputs: Small circle
printfn "%s" (describeShapeWithGuard (Rectangle (4.0, 4.0)))  // Outputs: Square
```

### Practical Example: Using Discriminated Unions

Let's create a more practical example to demonstrate how discriminated unions can be used to model and process different types of shapes:

```fsharp
type Shape =
    | Circle of radius: float
    | Rectangle of width: float * height: float
    | Triangle of base: float * height: float

let area shape =
    match shape with
    | Circle radius -> System.Math.PI * radius * radius
    | Rectangle (width, height) -> width * height
    | Triangle (base, height) -> 0.5 * base * height

let shapes = [
    Circle 5.0
    Rectangle (4.0, 6.0)
    Triangle (3.0, 4.0)
]

let totalArea = shapes |> List.sumBy area

printfn "Total area: %f" totalArea  // Outputs: Total area: 103.539816
```

In this example, we define a function `area` that calculates the area of a shape based on its type. We then create a list of shapes and calculate the total area of all shapes in the list.

Discriminated unions provide a flexible and expressive way to model data that can take on multiple forms, and pattern matching allows you to handle each form in a clear and concise manner. This combination makes discriminated unions a powerful tool in F# for building robust and maintainable applications.
