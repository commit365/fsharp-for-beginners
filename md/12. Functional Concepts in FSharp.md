## 12. Functional Concepts in F\#

F# is a functional-first language that emphasizes functional programming concepts. Two important concepts in functional programming are higher-order functions and partial application/currying.

### Higher-order Functions

Higher-order functions are functions that can take other functions as parameters or return functions as results. They are a powerful tool for creating flexible and reusable code.

#### Example: Higher-order Function

```fsharp
// A higher-order function that applies a function to a list
let applyToList (f: 'a -> 'b) (list: 'a list) : 'b list =
    List.map f list

// Using the higher-order function
let numbers = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5]
let double x = x * 2
let squared x = x * x

let doubledNumbers = applyToList double numbers
let squaredNumbers = applyToList squared numbers

printfn "Doubled: %A" doubledNumbers  // Outputs: Doubled: [2; 4; 6; 8; 10]
printfn "Squared: %A" squaredNumbers  // Outputs: Squared: [1; 4; 9; 16; 25]
```

#### Example: Returning a Function

```fsharp
// A function that returns another function
let multiply factor =
    fun x -> x * factor

let double = multiply 2
let triple = multiply 3

printfn "Double 5: %d" (double 5)  // Outputs: Double 5: 10
printfn "Triple 5: %d" (triple 5)  // Outputs: Triple 5: 15
```

### Partial Application and Currying

Partial application is the process of fixing a number of arguments to a function, producing another function of smaller arity. Currying is the technique of translating a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument.

In F#, all functions are automatically curried, which means they can be partially applied.

#### Example: Partial Application

```fsharp
// A function that takes three arguments
let add x y z = x + y + z

// Partially applying the function
let addFive = add 5
let addFiveAndTen = addFive 10

printfn "Result: %d" (addFiveAndTen 3)  // Outputs: Result: 18
```

#### Example: Currying

```fsharp
// A curried function
let multiply x y = x * y

// Using the function normally
let result1 = multiply 5 3
printfn "Result 1: %d" result1  // Outputs: Result 1: 15

// Partially applying the function
let double = multiply 2
let result2 = double 7
printfn "Result 2: %d" result2  // Outputs: Result 2: 14
```

### Practical Example: Combining Higher-order Functions and Partial Application

Let's create a more complex example that demonstrates the power of higher-order functions and partial application in solving real-world problems.

```fsharp
// Define a type for a simple product
type Product = {
    Name: string
    Price: decimal
    Category: string
}

// Create a list of products
let products = [
    { Name = "Apple"; Price = 0.5m; Category = "Fruit" }
    { Name = "Banana"; Price = 0.3m; Category = "Fruit" }
    { Name = "Carrot"; Price = 0.4m; Category = "Vegetable" }
    { Name = "Potato"; Price = 0.6m; Category = "Vegetable" }
]

// Higher-order function for filtering products
let filterProducts (predicate: Product -> bool) (products: Product list) =
    List.filter predicate products

// Higher-order function for applying a discount
let applyDiscount (discountRate: decimal) (product: Product) =
    { product with Price = product.Price * (1m - discountRate) }

// Partial application to create specific filters
let fruitFilter = filterProducts (fun p -> p.Category = "Fruit")
let cheapFilter = filterProducts (fun p -> p.Price < 0.5m)

// Partial application to create a specific discount
let tenPercentDiscount = applyDiscount 0.1m

// Combine operations
let discountedFruits =
    products
    |> fruitFilter
    |> List.map tenPercentDiscount

// Print results
printfn "Discounted Fruits:"
discountedFruits |> List.iter (fun p -> printfn "- %s: %.2f" p.Name p.Price)

let cheapProducts = cheapFilter products
printfn "\nCheap Products:"
cheapProducts |> List.iter (fun p -> printfn "- %s: %.2f" p.Name p.Price)
```

In this example:
1. We define higher-order functions `filterProducts` and `applyDiscount`.
2. We use partial application to create specific filters (`fruitFilter` and `cheapFilter`) and a specific discount function (`tenPercentDiscount`).
3. We combine these functions to create a pipeline that filters fruits and applies a discount.
4. We demonstrate how these concepts can be used to create flexible and reusable code for processing a list of products.

This example showcases how higher-order functions and partial application can lead to more modular, reusable, and expressive code in F#, allowing you to build complex operations from simple, composable parts.
