## 6. Immutability and Records

### Understanding Immutability

Immutability means that once a value is assigned to a variable, it cannot be changed. This is a fundamental concept in functional programming and is strongly emphasized in F#. Immutability leads to more predictable and less error-prone code.

#### Immutable Variables

In F#, variables declared with `let` are immutable by default:

```fsharp
let x = 10
// x <- 20  // This would cause an error because x is immutable
```

To create a mutable variable, you can use the `mutable` keyword, but it's generally discouraged unless necessary:

```fsharp
let mutable y = 10
y <- 20  // This is allowed because y is mutable
```

### Creating and Using Records

Records are a way to group related values together. They are immutable by default, but you can create new records with updated values easily.

#### Defining a Record Type

```fsharp
type Person = {
    Name: string
    Age: int
}
```

#### Creating a Record

```fsharp
let alice = { Name = "Alice"; Age = 30 }
let bob = { Name = "Bob"; Age = 25 }
```

#### Accessing Record Fields

```fsharp
let name = alice.Name  // "Alice"
let age = bob.Age      // 25
```

#### Copying and Updating Records

You can create a new record by copying an existing one and updating some fields:

```fsharp
let olderAlice = { alice with Age = 31 }
```

#### Pattern Matching with Records

You can use pattern matching to destructure records:

```fsharp
let describePerson person =
    match person with
    | { Name = "Alice"; Age = age } -> sprintf "Alice is %d years old" age
    | { Name = name; Age = age } -> sprintf "%s is %d years old" name age

printfn "%s" (describePerson alice)  // Outputs: Alice is 30 years old
printfn "%s" (describePerson bob)    // Outputs: Bob is 25 years old
```

### Practical Example: Working with Records

Let's create a simple example to demonstrate how to work with records in a practical scenario:

```fsharp
type Book = {
    Title: string
    Author: string
    Year: int
}

let book1 = { Title = "1984"; Author = "George Orwell"; Year = 1949 }
let book2 = { Title = "Brave New World"; Author = "Aldous Huxley"; Year = 1932 }

let describeBook book =
    sprintf "'%s' by %s, published in %d" book.Title book.Author book.Year

printfn "%s" (describeBook book1)  // Outputs: '1984' by George Orwell, published in 1949
printfn "%s" (describeBook book2)  // Outputs: 'Brave New World' by Aldous Huxley, published in 1932

// Updating a record
let updatedBook1 = { book1 with Year = 1950 }
printfn "%s" (describeBook updatedBook1)  // Outputs: '1984' by George Orwell, published in 1950
```

Immutability and records are essential concepts in F# that promote safe and predictable code. By understanding and using these features, you can write more robust and maintainable applications.
