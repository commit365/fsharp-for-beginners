## 4. Working with Collections

F# provides several collection types and powerful operations to work with them. Let's explore the most common collections and operations.

### Lists, Arrays, and Sequences

#### Lists

Lists in F# are immutable, singly-linked collections.

```fsharp
// Creating a list
let fruits = ["apple"; "banana"; "cherry"]

// Adding to the front of a list (cons operator)
let moreFruits = "orange" :: fruits

// Concatenating lists
let allFruits = fruits @ ["grape"; "kiwi"]

// Accessing elements
let firstFruit = fruits[0]  // "apple"
```

#### Arrays

Arrays are fixed-size, mutable collections.

```fsharp
// Creating an array
let numbers = [|1; 2; 3; 4; 5|]

// Modifying an array element
numbers[2] <- 10

// Creating an array with a specific size
let zeros = Array.zeroCreate 5  // [|0; 0; 0; 0; 0|]
```

#### Sequences

Sequences are lazy, potentially infinite collections.

```fsharp
// Creating a sequence
let evenNumbers = seq { for i in 1..10 -> i * 2 }

// Converting a sequence to a list
let evenList = evenNumbers |> Seq.toList
```

### Map, Filter, and Fold Operations

These operations are fundamental for working with collections in a functional way.

#### Map

Map applies a function to each element of a collection.

```fsharp
let numbers = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5]

// Using List.map
let squared = List.map (fun x -> x * x) numbers
// squared is [1; 4; 9; 16; 25]

// Using the |> operator
let doubled = numbers |> List.map (fun x -> x * 2)
// doubled is [2; 4; 6; 8; 10]
```

#### Filter

Filter selects elements from a collection based on a predicate function.

```fsharp
let numbers = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10]

// Using List.filter
let evens = List.filter (fun x -> x % 2 = 0) numbers
// evens is [2; 4; 6; 8; 10]

// Using the |> operator
let greaterThanFive = numbers |> List.filter (fun x -> x > 5)
// greaterThanFive is [6; 7; 8; 9; 10]
```

#### Fold

Fold (or reduce) combines the elements of a collection using a given function.

```fsharp
let numbers = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5]

// Sum all numbers
let sum = List.fold (+) 0 numbers
// sum is 15

// Create a string from numbers
let numberString = List.fold (fun acc x -> acc + x.ToString()) "" numbers
// numberString is "12345"
```

### Practical Example: Combining Operations

Let's combine these operations in a more complex example:

```fsharp
let people = [
    ("Alice", 25);
    ("Bob", 30);
    ("Charlie", 35);
    ("David", 40)
]

let averageAgeOfPeopleOver30 =
    people
    |> List.filter (fun (_, age) -> age > 30)
    |> List.map (fun (_, age) -> age)
    |> List.average

// averageAgeOfPeopleOver30 is 37.5
```

This example filters people over 30, extracts their ages, and calculates the average.

These collection types and operations form the backbone of data processing in F#. They allow you to express complex transformations and analyses in a concise and readable manner.
