## 14. Building a Simple Project

In this section, we will put together the concepts we've learned in F# to create a simple command-line application. We will build a basic task manager that allows users to add, list, and complete tasks.

### Putting It All Together

We'll use various F# features, including:
- **Records** to define the structure of a task.
- **Modules** to organize our code.
- **Pattern matching** to handle different commands.
- **Lists** to store tasks.
- **Async workflows** for any potential asynchronous operations (though our example will be simple).

### Creating a Small Command-Line Application

#### Step 1: Set Up Your Project

1. **Create a new F# console application**:
   ```sh
   dotnet new console -lang "F#" -o TaskManager
   cd TaskManager
   ```

2. **Open the project in your favorite editor** (e.g., Visual Studio Code).

#### Step 2: Define the Task Record

In the `Program.fs` file, define a record type for a task:

```fsharp
type Task = {
    Id: int
    Description: string
    IsCompleted: bool
}
```

#### Step 3: Create a Module for Task Management

Define a module to manage tasks:

```fsharp
module TaskManager =
    let mutable tasks = []
    let mutable nextId = 1

    let addTask description =
        let task = { Id = nextId; Description = description; IsCompleted = false }
        tasks <- task :: tasks
        nextId <- nextId + 1

    let listTasks () =
        tasks |> List.iter (fun task ->
            let status = if task.IsCompleted then "[X]" else "[ ]"
            printfn "%s %d: %s" status task.Id task.Description)

    let completeTask id =
        tasks <- tasks |> List.map (fun task ->
            if task.Id = id then { task with IsCompleted = true } else task)
```

#### Step 4: Create the Main Program Logic

In the `Program.fs` file, implement the main logic to handle user input:

```fsharp
open System

[<EntryPoint>]
let main argv =
    let rec loop () =
        printfn "\nTask Manager"
        printfn "1. Add Task"
        printfn "2. List Tasks"
        printfn "3. Complete Task"
        printfn "4. Exit"
        printf "Choose an option: "
        
        match Console.ReadLine() with
        | "1" ->
            printf "Enter task description: "
            let description = Console.ReadLine()
            TaskManager.addTask description
            printfn "Task added."
            loop ()
        | "2" ->
            TaskManager.listTasks()
            loop ()
        | "3" ->
            printf "Enter task ID to complete: "
            match Int32.TryParse(Console.ReadLine()) with
            | (true, id) -> 
                TaskManager.completeTask id
                printfn "Task %d marked as complete." id
            | _ -> printfn "Invalid ID."
            loop ()
        | "4" -> 
            printfn "Exiting..."
            0  // Exit the application
        | _ ->
            printfn "Invalid option. Please try again."
            loop ()

    loop ()
```

### Step 5: Run Your Application

1. **Build and run the application**:
   ```sh
   dotnet run
   ```

2. **Interact with the application**: You can add tasks, list them, and mark them as complete.

### Example Interaction

```
Task Manager
1. Add Task
2. List Tasks
3. Complete Task
4. Exit
Choose an option: 1
Enter task description: Buy groceries
Task added.

Task Manager
1. Add Task
2. List Tasks
3. Complete Task
4. Exit
Choose an option: 1
Enter task description: Clean the house
Task added.

Task Manager
1. Add Task
2. List Tasks
3. Complete Task
4. Exit
Choose an option: 2
[ ] 1: Buy groceries
[ ] 2: Clean the house

Task Manager
1. Add Task
2. List Tasks
3. Complete Task
4. Exit
Choose an option: 3
Enter task ID to complete: 1
Task 1 marked as complete.

Task Manager
1. Add Task
2. List Tasks
3. Complete Task
4. Exit
Choose an option: 2
[X] 1: Buy groceries
[ ] 2: Clean the house
```

### Conclusion

In this project, we've built a simple command-line task manager in F#. We defined a `Task` record to represent tasks, created a module to manage tasks, and implemented a loop to handle user input. This example demonstrates how to combine various F# features to create a functional application.

Feel free to expand on this project by adding features such as saving tasks to a file, loading tasks on startup, or implementing more complex commands. This will help reinforce your understanding of F# and functional programming concepts!
