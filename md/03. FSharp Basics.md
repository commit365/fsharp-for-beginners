## 3. F\# Basics

### Variables and Basic Data Types

In F#, variables are typically immutable by default, which means their values cannot be changed after they are assigned. Here's how to work with variables and some basic data types:

#### Declaring Variables

```fsharp
let myNumber = 42        // Integer
let myFloat = 3.14       // Float
let myString = "Hello"   // String
let myBoolean = true     // Boolean
```

Note: The `let` keyword is used to declare variables.

#### Basic Data Types

1. **Integers**: Whole numbers
   ```fsharp
   let age = 30
   let bigNumber = 1_000_000  // Underscores for readability
   ```

2. **Floating-point numbers**: Numbers with decimal points
   ```fsharp
   let pi = 3.14159
   let avogadro = 6.022e23  // Scientific notation
   ```

3. **Strings**: Text enclosed in double quotes
   ```fsharp
   let greeting = "Hello, World!"
   let multiline = """This is a
   multiline string"""
   ```

4. **Booleans**: True or false values
   ```fsharp
   let isActive = true
   let hasPermission = false
   ```

5. **Characters**: Single characters enclosed in single quotes
   ```fsharp
   let firstLetter = 'A'
   ```

### Functions and Function Syntax

Functions are a fundamental part of F#. Here's how to define and use functions:

#### Defining Functions

The basic syntax for defining a function is:

```fsharp
let functionName parameter1 parameter2 = 
    // Function body
    // The last expression is the return value
```

Examples:

```fsharp
// A simple function that adds two numbers
let add x y = x + y

// A function that greets a person
let greet name = 
    printfn "Hello, %s!" name

// A function with multiple lines
let isEven number = 
    if number % 2 = 0 then
        true
    else
        false
```

#### Calling Functions

To call a function, simply use its name followed by the arguments:

```fsharp
let sum = add 5 3        // Returns 8
greet "Alice"            // Prints: Hello, Alice!
let result = isEven 4    // Returns true
```

#### Function Composition

You can easily compose functions in F#:

```fsharp
let double x = x * 2
let square x = x * x

let doubleAndSquare = double >> square

let result = doubleAndSquare 3  // (3 * 2)^2 = 36
```

#### Anonymous Functions (Lambda Expressions)

You can create unnamed functions using the `fun` keyword:

```fsharp
let numbers = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5]
let doubledNumbers = List.map (fun x -> x * 2) numbers
// doubledNumbers is now [2; 4; 6; 8; 10]
```

These basics cover the fundamental concepts of variables, data types, and functions in F#. As you progress, you'll discover more advanced features and patterns that make F# a powerful and expressive language for various programming tasks.
