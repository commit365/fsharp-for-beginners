## 5. Pattern Matching

Pattern matching is a powerful feature in F# that allows you to match values against patterns and execute code based on the matched pattern. It's more powerful and expressive than traditional switch statements found in many other languages.

### Basic Pattern Matching

#### Simple Value Matching

```fsharp
let describeNumber x =
    match x with
    | 0 -> "Zero"
    | 1 -> "One"
    | 2 -> "Two"
    | _ -> "Other"  // The underscore _ is a wildcard that matches anything

printfn "%s" (describeNumber 1)  // Outputs: One
printfn "%s" (describeNumber 5)  // Outputs: Other
```

#### Matching with Guards

You can use guards (when clauses) to add additional conditions:

```fsharp
let categorizeNumber x =
    match x with
    | n when n < 0 -> "Negative"
    | 0 -> "Zero"
    | n when n % 2 = 0 -> "Positive Even"
    | _ -> "Positive Odd"

printfn "%s" (categorizeNumber -5)  // Outputs: Negative
printfn "%s" (categorizeNumber 4)   // Outputs: Positive Even
```

#### Matching Tuples

```fsharp
let describePerson (name, age) =
    match name, age with
    | "Alice", 30 -> "Alice is 30"
    | "Bob", _ -> "Bob's age is unknown"
    | _, age when age < 18 -> "A minor"
    | _ -> "An adult"

printfn "%s" (describePerson ("Alice", 30))  // Outputs: Alice is 30
printfn "%s" (describePerson ("Eve", 15))    // Outputs: A minor
```

### Pattern Matching with Collections

#### Matching Lists

```fsharp
let describeList list =
    match list with
    | [] -> "Empty list"
    | [single] -> sprintf "Single-element list with %A" single
    | [first; second] -> sprintf "Two-element list with %A and %A" first second
    | head :: tail -> sprintf "List with head %A and %d more elements" head (List.length tail)

printfn "%s" (describeList [])           // Outputs: Empty list
printfn "%s" (describeList [1])          // Outputs: Single-element list with 1
printfn "%s" (describeList [1; 2])       // Outputs: Two-element list with 1 and 2
printfn "%s" (describeList [1; 2; 3; 4]) // Outputs: List with head 1 and 3 more elements
```

#### Matching Arrays

```fsharp
let describeArray arr =
    match arr with
    | [||] -> "Empty array"
    | [|single|] -> sprintf "Single-element array with %A" single
    | [|first; second|] -> sprintf "Two-element array with %A and %A" first second
    | _ -> sprintf "Array with %d elements" (Array.length arr)

printfn "%s" (describeArray [||])           // Outputs: Empty array
printfn "%s" (describeArray [|1|])          // Outputs: Single-element array with 1
printfn "%s" (describeArray [|1; 2|])       // Outputs: Two-element array with 1 and 2
printfn "%s" (describeArray [|1; 2; 3; 4|]) // Outputs: Array with 4 elements
```

#### Matching Option Types

```fsharp
let describeOption opt =
    match opt with
    | Some value -> sprintf "Value present: %A" value
    | None -> "No value"

printfn "%s" (describeOption (Some 42))  // Outputs: Value present: 42
printfn "%s" (describeOption None)       // Outputs: No value
```

Pattern matching is a cornerstone of F# programming. It allows for concise and expressive code, especially when working with complex data structures or when you need to handle multiple cases based on the shape or content of your data.
